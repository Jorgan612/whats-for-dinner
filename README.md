This website allows you to choose a random recipe from the "What are you looking for?" for. You can choose between a random side, main dish, dessert by selecting the category you would like and clicking the "LET'S COOK!" button.
A random recipe will be displayed on the right hand side of the screen once the "LET'S COOK!" button is clicked.
